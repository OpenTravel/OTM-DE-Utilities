
1. Add tests for assigning types - make sure where used and uses arrays are correct after change.
2. built-ins in filter not working

3. ^Z = undo
4. forward/back button
5. Inheritance - show library and object where properties and facets are inherited from in Properties pane
6. Libraries (or namespaces) where used/contains/uses
"Namespace Entanglement"
DND - move/copy object to a different library from library tab
9. Used Types = menu to update to latest
10. Remember column setup

11. Drilling from Resource to object - how to start with a resource and understand more about the BO
	a. Putting in Members and TypeProviders view would require either making action facet a type provider or overrideing getChildrenTypeProvider() in OtmResource 
	b. Putting properties under actionFacet and parameter would require them to become children owners
	
11.a - give action facets children -- the actual data they contain since they are 1st class objects to the developers

12. give parameter a child which is the property it references

13. IGNORE - library view - do you need full namespace
14. Reset to default (or other resore thingy)
15. remember changes to column order and visability

16. Repository - filter by sub-section of a namespace (all "hospitality")
17. Low-risk way to know what is in the library (browswer pop-up?) (peek)
	DONE - both embedded and pop-up browser
	TODO - authorization credentials
	
18. Locked-only button repository filter
19. Last 10 Projects (not directory) + open option in drop down
20. Username and password - from launcher
21. How to compare 2 object
22. Graphical view
